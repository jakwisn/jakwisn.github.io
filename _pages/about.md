Hi I am Jakub Wisniewski - data scientist with expertise in AI and experience in researching and developing DS and ML solutions. Demonstrated leadership through academic and professional contributions, including research, mentorship, and organizing events. I am really interested in how AI can automate and help solving complex problems - especially the ones at scale.

Currently I am a student of artificial intelligence at DTU working as a data scientist in SEB. Right now I am working on my master thesis where I am deploying AI models based on ultrasound video feed that will act as navigational support for novice sonographers.

Upon graduation, I intend to seek a new position where I can leverage and further advance my skills in AI.
