Hi, I'm Jakub Wisniewski, a data scientist specializing in AI with a strong background in developing and researching data science and machine learning solutions. I have demonstrated leadership through my academic and professional contributions, including research, mentorship, and event organization. My passion lies in leveraging AI to automate and solve complex problems, particularly those at scale.

Currently, I am pursuing a degree in artificial intelligence at DTU while working as a data scientist at SEB. My masterâ€™s thesis involves deploying AI models based on ultrasound video feeds to provide navigational support for novice sonographers. I have extensive experience working with various data modalities, from tabular financial data to images, videos, and text.

Upon graduation, I am eager to find a new position where I can apply and further develop my AI skills.
